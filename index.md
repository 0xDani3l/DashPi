## What is the DashPi?

The DashPi at is a Raspberry Pi based GPS Dashcam which can be customised to perform a wide variety tasks such as Car Diagnostics, Media playing, or even object detection.

This site aims to act as a guide for anyone who wishes to build their own version of this project.

### Configuring Hardware
The Hardware portion of this system is quite simple. Simply plug in your GPS into one of the blue USB 3.0 ports on the Pi. A red light should appear on the device. 

TIP - GPS Modules can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes to fully boot and obtain a signal. Please be patient, and make sure your GPS module is placed in a location that recieves optimal connection. You can use your phone's service bar as an indicator of a spot with a good signal. 

The physical aspect of this project can be as full fledged as you like. Personally, I was on a tight budget and time constraints, so I used cheaper modules and did not build a chassis for the components.
